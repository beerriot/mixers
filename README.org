Mixers is a collection of useful utilities for functional programming.

The [[file:src/gin.erl][gin]] module implements function-based "generators" to
facilitate iteration without, for example, first having to build a list
for use with lists:fold, :map, etc.

The [[file:src/mayo.erl][mayo]] module implements "do", "while", and "loop" functions
to make it easier to analyze structures recursively using anonymous
functions (as is often the case in the Erlang console).
